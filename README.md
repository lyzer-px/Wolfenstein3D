- **Authorized functions:** `all`

**Time to complete**: _6 weeks_

## Project Overview

This project consists of creating a clone of the classic game Wolfenstein 3D. The goal is to de-
velop a 3D first-person shooter using a simple rendering technique, raycasting This project will
put skills in programming, software development and game design into practice. Our main
challenge for this project is to create a complete product using everything.

By the end of this project, we are supposed to have:
  - ✓ A pleasant and user-friendly interface.
  - ✓ A coherent universe, including consistent visual assets, audio, and scenario.
  - ✓ A fun game where the player has at least one clear goal.
  - ✓ A game with a beginning and an end, offering a complete gameplay experience.

For this project, we had to make a video game, like the famous Wolfenstein 3D, in frist-person view. We use raycasting. We have for example:
